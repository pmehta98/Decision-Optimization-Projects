# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Analysis 2

This repository contains solutions to **business decision-making scenarios** using decision trees and the **TreePlan** add-in for Excel. The analysis addresses two cases:
1. **Brainy Business Case (Part 2)** â€“ Continued exploration of optimal pricing strategies for a new product by **Cerebrosoft** and the value of additional market research.
2. **Fruit Stand Case** â€“ Evaluation of sampling strategies to maximize profit when deciding whether to accept a fruit box.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### **1. Brainy Business Case (Part 2)**
- **Objective**: Optimize pricing strategy for the launch of **Brainet** and evaluate whether paying $10,000 for additional market research is justified.
- **Key Insights**:
  1. **Pricing Strategy**:
     - The **High Price strategy ($50)** remains optimal under most competitive scenarios, delivering the highest EMV.
     - Sensitivity analysis confirms this across variations in competition probabilities.
  2. **Market Research Evaluation**:
     - Without market research: Expected payoff = **$1,465,000**.
     - With market research: Expected payoff = **$1,455,000** (adjusted for the $10,000 cost).
     - Recommendation: Market research does not provide sufficient value to justify the cost.
- **Highlights**:
  - Conducted sensitivity analysis to explore pricing decisions under varying competition scenarios.
  - Analyzed risk profiles to understand trade-offs between price options.

### **2. Fruit Stand Case**
- **Objective**: Maximize Ericaâ€™s profit by deciding whether to sample fruit from a box before accepting or rejecting it.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Sampling increases the **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** by $34 compared to not sampling.
  - Optimal decisions based on sampling outcome:
    - **Accept the box** if the sample fruit tastes excellent.
    - **Reject the box** if the sample fruit tastes poor.
- **Highlights**:
  - Modeled the sampling decision process using a decision tree.
  - Quantified the financial benefit of sampling in terms of increased EMV.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Decision Tree Analysis**:
   - Built decision trees using **TreePlan** in Excel for structured decision-making.
   - Incorporated sensitivity analysis to assess optimal pricing strategies under varying probabilities.
2. **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)**:
   - Calculated EMV for each decision to identify optimal choices.
   - Quantified the financial value of market research and fruit sampling.
3. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Evaluated risk profiles of pricing strategies to understand trade-offs between high, medium, and low price options.
