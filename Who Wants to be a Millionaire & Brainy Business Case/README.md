# üåü Decision Tree and Business Case Analysis

This repository contains solutions to two complex decision-making scenarios that demonstrate the power of **decision trees** and **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** calculations in identifying optimal strategies. The analyses are structured to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview

### **1. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?**
- **Objective**: Optimize strategy as a contestant on the game show to maximize winnings.
- **Key Insights**:
  1. **$500,000 Question**:
     - Answer without using the "Phone a Friend" lifeline to preserve it for later.
     - Success probability: **65%**, with an expected payout of **$661,200**.
  2. **$1,000,000 Question**:
     - If successful on the $500,000 question, proceed and use the lifeline to maximize the chance of success (**65%** probability).
     - Risk trade-off: Potential fallback to $32,000 if unsuccessful, but the payout justifies the calculated risk.

### **2. Brainy Business Case**
- **Objective**: Assist **Charlotte Rothstein**, CEO of Cerebrosoft, in deciding whether to launch the new product (**Brainet**) and selecting the best pricing strategy.
- **Key Insights**:
  1. **Launch Decision**:
     - Launching Brainet is recommended to avoid the **$800,000 sunk cost loss** of abandoning the product.
  2. **Pricing Strategy**:
     - The **High Price Strategy ($50)** provides the highest EMV, balancing competition scenarios and maximizing revenue potential.
  3. **Market Analysis**:
     - Constructed decision trees to evaluate payoffs under different competition levels:
       - Severe (20%), Moderate (70%), Weak (10%).
       - Determined sales outcomes (High: 50,000 units, Medium: 30,000 units, Low: 20,000 units).
  4. **Optimal Recommendation**:
     - Adopt the **High Price ($50)** strategy as it achieves the highest rollback value, offering the best balance of risk and reward.
