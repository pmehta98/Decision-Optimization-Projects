# ðŸŒŸ Decision Tree and Business Case Analysis

This repository contains the solutions and analysis for two decision-making scenarios: the **"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" strategy optimization** and the **Brainy Business Case**. Both scenarios leverage decision trees and Expected Monetary Value (EMV) to identify optimal strategies.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### **1. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?**
- **Objective**: Maximize expected winnings as a contestant in the game show.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Used TreePlan to analyze probabilities and payoffs for various strategies.
  - Determined the best course of action:
    1. Answer the $500,000 question without using the "Phone a Friend" lifeline.
    2. If successful, proceed to the $1,000,000 question and use the lifeline for maximum success probability.

### **2. Brainy Business Case**
- **Objective**: Help **Charlotte Rothstein**, CEO of Cerebrosoft, decide whether to launch a new product (**Brainet**) and at what price.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Constructed a decision tree using TreePlan to evaluate scenarios based on pricing strategies ($50, $40, $30) and market competition levels (severe, moderate, weak).
  - Analyzed sales outcomes and determined the best strategy:
    1. Launch Brainet.
    2. Use the high pricing strategy ($50) to maximize EMV.
  - The high-pricing strategy also achieved the highest rollback value.
