# üåü Decision Analysis and Optimization Projects

Welcome to the **Decision Analysis and Optimization Projects Repository**! This repository features a collection of **real-world decision-making problems** tackled using advanced techniques like **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**, **Decision Trees**, and **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** calculations. Each project demonstrates structured problem-solving and optimization strategies across diverse scenarios.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Portfolio

### **1. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? & Brainy Business Case**
- **Objective**: Solve complex strategic decision-making problems using decision trees and EMV.
- **Key Scenarios**:
  1. **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?**
     - Optimize the contestant's strategy for maximizing winnings in the game show.
     - Recommendation:
       - Use the "Phone a Friend" lifeline at the $1,000,000 question for maximum probability of success.
  2. **Brainy Business Case**:
     - Help **Cerebrosoft's CEO** determine the best pricing strategy for their new product, **Brainet**, under competitive market scenarios.
     - Recommendation:
       - Launch the product at a **high price ($50/unit)** to maximize profitability across different competition levels.

### **2. Brainy Business Case (Part 2) & Fruit Salad Case**
- **Objective**: Extend decision analysis with advanced scenarios involving market research and sampling strategies.
- **Key Scenarios**:
  1. **Brainy Business Case (Part 2)**:
     - Evaluate the value of investing $10,000 in additional market research to refine pricing strategy.
     - Recommendation:
       - Skip the market research, as it does not improve the EMV significantly.
  2. **Fruit Salad Case**:
     - Decide whether to sample fruit before accepting or rejecting a box to maximize profit.
     - Recommendation:
       - **Sample** the fruit to increase EMV and make informed decisions based on quality.

### **3. Machine Maintenance & Robot Navigation**
- **Objective**: Optimize operational decisions using MDPs to maximize rewards and minimize costs.
- **Key Scenarios**:
  1. **Machine Maintenance**:
     - Develop a policy for maintaining, repairing, or replacing machines to maximize long-term profits.
     - Recommendation:
       - **Maintain** the machine when running and **replace** it when broken.
     - Policies optimized for both 10- and 20-week time horizons.
  2. **Robot Navigation**:
     - Determine the optimal path for a robot navigating a gridworld with stochastic movements to maximize rewards.
     - Recommendation:
       - For higher uncertainty (`p = 0.1`), adopt safer routes to reduce penalty risks.
